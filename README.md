[**HashX**](https://hashx.vercel.app/ ) is chrome extension using which you can access all the Hashnode blogs on every website

With HashX, you have the convenience of accessing Hashnode's features anywhere on the webpage, be it **reading blogs, exploring profiles, scrolling through your feeds, or managing bookmarks,** all without leaving your current webpage.

Designed exclusively for Hashnode users, this extension taps into the heart of Hashnodeâ€”a free developer blogging platform that not only enables you to publish articles on your own domain but also connects you with a global developer community.

 Hashnode helps you establish a personal or team blog on your domain at no cost, ensuring your content's visibility, reach, and independence are uncompromised.

HashX introduces a **sidebar** that seamlessly integrates into any website you visit. This sidebar, equipped with a navigation bar, allows for opening and closing and also to navigate to different sections. The design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, requiring Hashnode users to log in using a Personal Access Token. Rest assured, this token is securely stored in the local storage of the extension, with no data being stored in any external databases.

Upon logging in, users gain access to a lot of features including profiles, feeds, bookmarks, user search, and podcasts, all designed to enrich the Hashnode browsing experience.
